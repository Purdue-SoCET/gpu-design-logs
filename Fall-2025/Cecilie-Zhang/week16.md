# Week 16
**State:** I don't need help right now

**Progress:**
- Finished the final report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umsvhU7vWJ85TJ8U6pIjHlHwXEKXv-fpdOEWDG_8ds8/edit?usp=sharing
- Submitted wiki, IPE, reflection, proposal, PD activites, catme, and course eval :))
- Overall, I think this semester has been pretty rewarding, and look forward to (don't jinx it) render the cube next semester
