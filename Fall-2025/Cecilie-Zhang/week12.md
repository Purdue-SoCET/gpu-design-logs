# Week 12
**State:** I don't need help right now

**Progress:**
- I didn't have too much time due to two exams and a presentation this week
- I looked through my code again to refresh before the code review on Sunday
- I briefly looked at Andrew's load and store and realized I didn't implement my inputs and outputs to go to latches
- I was getting confused on how to implement latches because there were many classes are in different branches and I wasn't sure which one was the most recent. Looked up in Yash's branch how she had done the latches with the stage class and followed that
- Pushed the caches with the latches to the github named dcache_wip.py
- Created lsu_cache.py to test the integration between the lsu and the cache but I didn't quite understand how to make the interfaces connection with the lsu. Have to ask Andrew about it. I also didn't really get how the requests were being sent to the cache through the interfaces. Need to ask about that too.
- Worked on the poster presentation on Tuesday

**Next Steps:**
- Talk to Andrew about the LSU and the interfaces between the cache and the LSU
- Set memory and dcache interaction so that the cache would read directly from the meminit.hex and dump everything to memsim.hex
- EXPO Presentation
- Start on the final report and get a first draft done by thanksgiving break (hopefully)
