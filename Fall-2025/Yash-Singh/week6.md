Key goals of this week: ironing out interface aand implementation details across front end, backend, and compilers team as needed.

Roadblocks: N/A thus far, I definetily need more information about threadblock schedulinng. Might show Sooraj something about the flow and double check my understanding of it.

Plans for next Week:
 1) Present and get feedback on design during the design review
 2) Order presentations across teams for review
 3) Continue making better documentation!

Links to readings, documents, and notes taken this week:

1. I read up more on operand collectors and what they do, as well as researched more about warp scheduling details. I didn't get much out of the papers I tried to read up on for our purposes, but it did clear up what I did and did NOT need to know.

2. Draw io links (did the predicate resgiter logic!): https://app.diagrams.net/#G1zLESrLZCIRFvtnY3vko3Y-sId9EeJUVy#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22v1HIqL6wrUNI0ak0bKRv%22%7D
