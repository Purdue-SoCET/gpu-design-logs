Summary: This week was focused on working on the presentation and cleaning up the functional simulation.
Major work wise, nothing significant was changed in the design. I focused on cleaning up my parts and reclarifying them with the rest of the team so we would all be on the same page.
I created some visuals for the presentation, and included more robust test cases from my original work.
I additionally attempted some level of integration testing with te fetch unit, and demonstrated succesfful simulation capability between the icache and memory for the fetch stage.
