WEEK 7 DESIGN LOG UPDATE:

STATUS UPDATE: I need to know about the simulation stuff to get an idea of stuff over the break. We have 20 days to accomplish this,,,hopefully its enough.
SUMMARY: This week consisted of preparing for design review. My group met up on Saturday (10/4/2025 - 10/05/2025) and worked well into the night to reform the RTL structure and the presentation.

What I did this week:
1. Research the python simulators and see what can and what can't work for us. Sooraj said to wait for more updates.
2. Worked on the RTLS for: predicate register file and unit, branch unit for the backend, as well as the software-hardware co-design flow (with software managed stack for nested conditionals, and hardware to actually read the files as needed).
3. Updated presentation to accurately portray the flow and consolidate group knowledge.
4. Communicated across teams to see if everyone was on a similar pages regarding the design approach.
5. Took feedback from the meeting and integrated the negation look up into the table per predicate register entry as well.
6. Meeting on Thursday 10/9/25 to discuss functional simulation goal, rough idea, and group division of project expectations.
