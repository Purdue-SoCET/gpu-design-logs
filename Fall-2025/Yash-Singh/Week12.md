LATE DESIGN LOG--SORRY FOR THE DELAY. I'D LIKE YOU TO KNOW THAT UPDATES ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.
Summary:
This week was focused on getting the functional units tests working for the design review upcoming next week, as well as refining our preexisting content for the research conference next week. I wasn't able to do much due to back to back exams and labs being due as well.
I ended up skipping the general hardware meeting for prep for my exam. More work will be seen later.
