No further assistance needed, end of the semester.

Summary: the goal for this week was to finish the final report for the project. I'd started with the initial version over thanksgiving break already.
I contributed to the following parts: abstract and introduction, predication and decode sections of the following subsections, researching the Vortex paper from GT to get more references, and establising some of the initial formattng.
In the larger work, I expanded some of the smoke tests in my respective units (decode, mem, icache) to be more comprehensive and provide the reviewers a thorough background of what is being used to verify baseline functionality.

Meetings:
Sunday, Dec 7th: -- general team meeting to get together and hone out the remaining structure for the project.
Monday-Wed Dec 8th-10th -- continuous meetings here and there with the rest of the hardware team to do writing sessions together and review parts as needed.
