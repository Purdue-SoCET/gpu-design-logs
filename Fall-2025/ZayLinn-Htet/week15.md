# Week 15 Design Log
## 12/05/25 - 12/11/25
I am not currently stuck or blocked

## Sunday (12/07/25) - Final Report Preparation
- Discussed about what else we can get done with the remaining time of the semester
- The Predication has been set, but not in the binary, and we're attempting to add to on a per-block basis
- Pranav says he can work on in this week because he doesn't have anything much else
- I brought up the current rought composition of the control loop implementation
- CJump and gen_condition are still utilized in the compiler due to the recursive feature of determining conditions
- Graphics also brought this up as an issue we need to address
- Need to go into codegenerator.py and clean up the code
- I created a document for the report with the format we made and brainstormed sections we should talk about
- These sections ranged from our ISA development (brainstorming ideas of 32 or 64 bit instr; rfc bits, packetization policies, ast/ir implementations, predication stack and usage, etc.)
- Talked about report and when we want to get it done by
- We chose sections we worked on to write about and would set off to finish them on our own
- Took farewell group photo with everyone!

## Tuesday (12/09/25) - Review all Weekly Logs and Categorize Developments
- Created sections for ISA, Predication, Packetization, RFC, and PPCI on our report document
- Went through every weekly log I wrote this semester and copied relevant notes on progress into a corresponding category
- Marked weeks as well to denote what periods of the semester these were worked on
- Started reviewing rubric for format of content to focus on (Problem->Solution->Result)
- Started writing paragraphs for the ISA section with subsections for instr size and immediate size
- Decided a lot was discussed on the ISA at the begining of the semester so added more subsections

## Wednesday (12/10/25) - Do Most of the Writing Needed
- Finished up writing for the ISA subsection and cleaned it up from yesterday
- Started working and finished up the Control Flow and Predication Implementation Section in the Design Choices
- I made sure to still follow the Problem->Solution->Result flow and specified performance benefits and drawbacks
- In the Microarchitecture section, I worked on and finished the Twig ISA and Teal Card, Intermediate Representation and Code Gen subsections
- When reviewing through the report, I found out that we didn't have enough context so I added a PPCI subsection in Design Choices, and a PPCI Compilation subsection in Microarchitecture
- I also found that we covered a good amount on the Register File Cache so it's definitely worth having it as a subsection in Design Choices
- When writing all my parts, I added references to other subsections to gain better or early context, and I will be attributing links to them later
- I also set up Figures for some explanations that I will create later

## Thursday (12/11/25) - Finish up Diagrams and Entire Report
- I created all the Figures I had set up the report for and successfully added them to the report
- I went through the entire report fixing syntax, formating, Figure Numbers and references
- I finished up the Results and Results Discussion sections for the Control Flow
- I read through the Introduction, Background and Abstract to figure out how to write the Conclusion
- I checked everything with my teammates; finished everything up; and printed and binded the final report

## Thursday (12/11/25) - Final SoCET Meeting of the Semesters
- Final meeting of the semester!
- Next meeting on January 15th of 2026
- Heard honorable mentions of very achieved students with their works and job opportunities
- Took a final group photo as a farewell
- Thank you for the great semester!
