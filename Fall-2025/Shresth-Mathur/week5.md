# Explicit Statement: I am not stuck

**Progress:**

* Gave presentation on my senior design project to Dr. Mark Johnson and other SoCET Team Leads (Monday 9/22)  
  * Feedback:  
    * I looked very confident and was able to explain my thoughts clearly while presenting  
    * Was able to get my point across  
    * Should have made the background different because it was not contrasting with the words very well; made it hard to see/read  
    * Should have added a bit about deliverables and timeline  
    * Could have talked more on the technical/implementation part (but would have to weigh options considering it should only be a 5 min presentation)  
    * Hassan asked what parts of the project I should parameterize:  
      * I said the number of scalar cores per SIMT core  
      * Number of threads to be scalarized (saturating counter limit)  
* Explained my project to numerous potential recruits that could help me code the architecture in C++ since itâ€™s a massive project and any help on it would be greatly appreciated  
  * So far there is one person that may join me on this project  
    * Akshath Raghav  
* Currently reviewing scheduler code since that is the first component that I will work on


**Future Plans:**

* Need to meet with Akshath this weekend or next week to discuss project concepts, deliverables, timelines, goals  
  * Will text him about his availability ASAP  
* Need to continue looking through scheduler code and understanding the architecture deeply  
* Need to brush up on C++ (GEM5 should help with that) in order to get scheduler code progressing
