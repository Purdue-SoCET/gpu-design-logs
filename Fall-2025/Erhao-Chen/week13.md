# Week 13
statement: I am not stuck.

## Progress this week
This week, we worked on three major presentations: the GPU team code review, the Research Expo poster, and the full design review for the SoCET leads.

- Code review:
  - Compiler team
    - specificatopm of Twig ISA
    - demonstrate IR generation, which shows that how c code loops and conditions can be compiled to assembly.
  - Hardware team
    - work through the issue stage talk about the emulator for testing.
      
- Research poster

- Design review

## plan of the team
  - migrate kernels to compiler
  - optimize of software side to accommodate hardware thread limits.
  - have a function similar to the cpu sim to schedule the gpu emulator
