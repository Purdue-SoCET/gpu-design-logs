Status: not stuck (at all!)

Week 15
Finally "finished" the emulator and had it run (correctly) saxpy!!
Fixed FP calculation
Worked with Tushsar (graphics) and told him what errors there are in his software
Committed the changes

Overall, I feel super happy and glad that I had something tangible to prove

Week 16
Documented the emulator in the final report, as well as some more information about register files and a few diagrams.
