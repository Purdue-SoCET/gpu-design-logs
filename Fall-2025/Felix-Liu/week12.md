Status: not stuck

Work done:
- reworked warp.py and emulator.py logic to support threadblocks, updating from a single warp.
- can currently run all warps, all threads on each warp
- poster started, filled out general format
- updated and corrected Makefile. Currently assumes 1 threadblock of 1024 threads
