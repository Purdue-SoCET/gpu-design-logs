Progress:

I am not stuck with anything right now.

GPU subteam: Graphics

## Overview

Week was mostly fall break

### Subteam Meeting

This week the team submitted the abstract. This helped us to determine some of what we felt would be important. We named the library "Nest". An assembler was created by the compiler team. Currently, we will plan to write C code and asm unit tests for the python functional simulator.

Communication regarding how the binary file will be loaded into the simulator is ongoing. We want to have clear parameters and segments within the binary so that the GPU can correctly execute in a way that mimics the intended final product. 

The program we write will not immediately be compile-able. Instead, we will simulate a GPU. The intention is to run our code on a regular CPU, and do this 1024 times, in a way that simulates a GPU. 

While discussing, we realized that we do not know how the compilers team is expecting a GPU C file to look. This includes keywords and syntax that will result in specific functional units being recognized and used. The intent is to discuss this with the compilers team at the GPU meeting.

This design log is short because of break. Much more work will be done for week 9 now that there is a plan to write code.
