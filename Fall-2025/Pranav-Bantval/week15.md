# week 15

multiple conditionals in if/else/while statements need to be looked at

e.g. if(a>b||c<d), the || is done as a recursive call right now, need another way to do it. 

graphics recommended taking everything out, putting it into a variable and calculating it e.g. 

```int check = a>b | c<d; ```

```if(check){}```
