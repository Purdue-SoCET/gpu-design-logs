# Week 4

State: PPCI is confusing to use but I just started so I will continue experimenting 

Progress: started using ppci, haven't done the chapter 5 reading (i will try to complete by sunday meeting)

## Compilers work

- cloned ppci
- generated this image for mergesort
- i do not know whats going on in this image.
- i tried to compile it past the intermediate representation stage and into riscv before displaying controlflow but still work in progress.
