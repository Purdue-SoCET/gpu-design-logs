## Work Completed

### Compiling Triangle Kernel

- was able to get triangle kernel to compile on custom compiler 
- still need to compile with updated header file for easy switching between cpu and gpu sim 
- currently using ```python3 gpu-ppci-compiler/compile_twig.py [*file to compile*] ``` but was told that ``` twig [*file to compile*]  ``` can be used

### Emulator Main

- began writing python emulator main file to run each shader on the emulator
- need to take cpu sim main and store triangles and textures into meminit.hex file 
- starting with vertex shader
- will try to finish this before sunday meeting

### Final report

- not much progress made on this so far but will work on it this weekend and next week
