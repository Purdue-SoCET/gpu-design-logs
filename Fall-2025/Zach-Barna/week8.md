# Explicit Statement: I am not stuck or blocked.

# Progress:
I have began working on the functional simulator for the fetch stage, but am running into some troubles that I will need to talk with teammates about to help get resolved. Other than that, I did not make much progress this week due to October break, as well as studying for the 437 exam.

# Future Plans: 
Next steps are to talk with teammates and Jing about figuring out the functional simulator, as well as seeing where everyone else's progress is on the functional simulator blocks as well. We also still need to have a meeting to make sure all of the signals we have per stage align, as the majority of people in frontend + backend are in 437 and were also studying for the exam last week. Progress for next week will be much better on my end, as I have more time to allocate to working on the functional simulator for fetch and issue stages.
