# Week 16 Design Log
## Explicit Statement: I am not stuck or blocked.
## Progress
This week I worked own my sections of the final report. I did not have time to work on any cycle-accurate simulator stuff.

## Next Steps

Our next steps are going to be implementing all of our smoke tests for individual modules to ensure they are all functioning correctly. After we get to this point, we will integrate FE separately, and BE separately, and ensure everything works on their own. Then we will do full FE + BE integration, and once that passes all the smoke tests for top-level, then we will make multiple copies of the sim with different architecture designs and run them in Cacti simulations to determine which implementation has the best PPA. That is the architecture we will choose to implement in RTL (if we get there), otherwise we will continue to alter the cycle-accurate simulator for best PPA metrics. This is our plan for next semester.
